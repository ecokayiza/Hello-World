# **some words to say**
## **intro**
- I am currently interested in cpp and python, and honestly I don't know how far I can go.
- Basically this repo is specially used to store my code though I will definately programme, run and check my codes in local but the repo can really be a personal space and makes everything that I might encounter through out my whole learning progress meaningful and memorable.
- I am indeed a greenhand and will make tones of mistakes.
